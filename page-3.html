   <h1>A Follower Of Christ</h1>   
     <p>Since I was born, people throughout my life have told me to follow God. To this day I've been on the same path following my Christian beliefs. As I grow older, I begin to think of the difficult questions of life. When I think like this, I go to the Bible.<p>
     <p>I usually read the King James Bible. This version is more reliable to historic sayings than the other Bibles out today.</p>

	 <li>Mark 11:24
	 <div>"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours"</div></li>
	 <li>John 1:1
         <div>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"</div></li>
